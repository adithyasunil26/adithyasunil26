<h3 align="center">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

<p align="justify">
  I'm a senior at IIIT-H pursuing my BTech (Hons.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I'm also an undergraduate researcher working under the guidance of <a href="https://fac-webpages.iiit.ac.in/abhishek/">Dr. Abhishek Srivastava</a> in the IC~WiBES Research Lab (Integrated Circuits inspired by Wireless and Biomedical Electronic Systems) at the Centre for VLSI and Embedded System Technologies, IIIT-H. I was a Google Summer of Code 2021 student developer at the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc">FuseSoC</a> integration of <a href="https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl">BaseJump STL</a> in <a href="https://github.com/adithyasunil26/basejump_stl_cores">basejump_stl_cores</a>. I am currently working on deep learning based object classification using FMCW radars. I have previously wroked on low gain variation voltage controlled oscillator design and frequency synthesizer/microwave signal generator design for quantum sensing applications and deep learning based respiratory sound classification.
