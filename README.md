<h2 align="center">About me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª </h2>

<p align="justify">
I am currently at IIIT-H pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech+MS) in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I was an undergraduate researcher working under the guidance of <a href="https://fac-webpages.iiit.ac.in/abhishek/">Dr. Abhishek Srivastava</a> in the IC~WiBES Research Lab (Integrated Circuits inspired by Wireless and Biomedical Electronic Systems) at the Centre for VLSI and Embedded System Technologies, IIIT-H. I was also a Google Summer of Code 2021 student developer at the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc">FuseSoC</a> integration of <a href="https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl">BaseJump STL</a> in <a href="https://github.com/adithyasunil26/basejump_stl_cores">basejump_stl_cores</a>. I have previously wroked on low gain variation voltage controlled oscillator design and frequency synthesizer/microwave signal generator design for quantum sensing applications, deep learning based respiratory sound classification and deep learning based object classification using FMCW radars.
